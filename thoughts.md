I'm unclear on the purpose of the usage file. Should a student get exclusively questions from that file if it's supplied? That is a possible implication but may not be correct. Looking at the file doesn't help; it has the information described and nothing else.

I'm going to operate under the assumption that all assigned but unanswered questions (in a Standard/Strand) should be assigned before any other
